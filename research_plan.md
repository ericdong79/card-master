# Research Plan: Anki-like Memory-First Learning System

## Research Objective
Research Anki-like memory-first learning systems with RemNotes as reference, focusing on implementable approaches for a simpler version.

## Initial Reconnaissance Findings

### Key Areas Identified
1. **Scheduling Algorithms**: SM-2 (Anki), FSRS (modern alternative)
2. **RemNotes**: Uses Anki SM-2 with modifications, Concept/Descriptor Framework
3. **Card Design**: Andy Matuschak's prompt-writing principles
4. **Cognitive Science**: Spacing effect, retrieval practice, forgetting curve
5. **Simple Implementations**: Multiple open-source simplified implementations

## Research Threads (10 parallel investigations)

| # | Thread | Focus | Researcher Assignment |

| 1 | SM-2 Algorithm Implementation | Detailed algorithm, parameters, edge cases | Researcher 1 |
| 2 | RemNotes Architecture | Memory-first design, features, data models | Researcher 2 |
| 3 | Simplified Scheduling Approaches | Minimal viable algorithms, what can be simplified | Researcher 3 |
| 4 | Card Design Best Practices | Prompt writing principles, atomic concepts | Researcher 4 |
| 5 | Cognitive Science Fundamentals | Spacing effect, retrieval practice, memory consolidation | Researcher 5 |
| 6 | Data Models & Persistence | Card schemas, review history, scheduling state | Researcher 6 |
| 7 | User Experience Patterns | Review interface, card creation workflow | Researcher 7 |
| 8 | Knowledge Organization | Hierarchies, tagging, linking concepts | Researcher 8 |
| 9 | FSRS vs SM-2 Comparison | Modern alternatives, pros/cons for simple implementation | Researcher 9 |
| 10 | Practical Implementation Patterns | Real-world code examples, common patterns | Researcher 10 |

## Expected Outputs
- `research_notes/` directory with 10 detailed markdown files
- `anki-like-memory-learning-system-report.md` - Comprehensive synthesis
- `anki-like-memory-learning-system-sources.md` - Complete bibliography

## Research Constraints
- Focus on implementable approaches for a simpler version
- Reference RemNotes but prioritize simplicity
- Include both theoretical understanding and practical implementation details
