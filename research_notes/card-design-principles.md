# Card Design and Prompt-Writing Principles

## Summary

Effective flashcard design is fundamentally about creating tasks that your future self can perform efficiently and consistently to reinforce memory through retrieval practice. The research reveals that card design should focus on atomic, focused questions that activate specific knowledge components rather than broad, unfocused prompts that lead to inconsistent retrieval. Multiple sources converge on the principle that prompts should be concise, precise, unambiguous, and designed to invoke effortful retrieval from memory. The act of creating cards itself is a powerful learning activity that combines elaborative encoding, the generation effect, and retrieval practice—making the process of card creation as valuable as the cards themselves.

The literature emphasizes that good cards are "learned before they are memorized"—meaning you should only create cards for material you already understand fundamentally. Cards should integrate with broader knowledge structures rather than existing in isolation. Visual elements, mnemonics, and personal connections dramatically improve retention through elaborative encoding. The most effective card types are simple question-answer pairs, cloze deletions for structured content, and image occlusion for visual information. Common mistakes include vague questions, yes/no format, mixing multiple concepts on one card, and failing to consider the future self who will review the card.

The research consistently shows that quality matters more than quantity when creating cards. A smaller set of well-designed atomic cards that test understanding from multiple angles is far more effective than large numbers of poorly-designed cards that create "flashcard hell." Effective card creation is about designing tasks for your future self—thinking like a learning strategist rather than a mere collector of information.

## Key Principles

- **Atomic concepts**: Each card should focus on one discrete piece of knowledge or a single idea
- **Clear, unambiguous prompts**: Questions should be precise about what answer they expect, leaving no room for ambiguity
- **One question per card**: Avoid mixing multiple ideas or concepts on a single card as this leads to incomplete retrievals and self-delusion
- **Multiple angles for understanding**: Test the same concept from different perspectives (what, why, how, when) to build robust understanding
- **Avoid yes/no questions**: These promote shallow pattern matching and don't require meaningful retrieval
- **Learn before memorize**: Only create cards for material you already understand; cards are for practice, not initial learning
- **Effortful retrieval**: Questions should require active retrieval from memory, not trivial inference from the question itself
- **Consistent answers**: Prompts should produce consistent answers each time they're reviewed
- **Contextual integration**: Cards should connect to broader knowledge structures, not exist in isolation
- **Future-self oriented**: Design cards thinking about the person who will review them months or years later

## Card Types

### Basic Question-Answer Cards
The most flexible and widely-used format. A question on the front prompts for a specific answer on the back. Works for facts, lists, complex concepts, formulas, patterns/mnemonics, and conditional facts.

**Best for:**
- Simple facts and definitions
- Procedural steps
- Cause-and-effect relationships
- When-to-apply scenarios
- Conditional knowledge

**Example:**
```
Front: What is the ratio of chicken bones to water in chicken stock?
Back: A quart of water per pound of bones
```

### Cloze Deletion Cards
Fill-in-the-blank format where part of a sentence or sequence is hidden. Excellent for structured content with fixed ordering like lyrics, poems, or sequential information.

**Best for:**
- Sequences and ordered lists
- Formulas and equations
- Verbatim quotes or passages
- Lists where order matters

**Example:**
```
Question: Typical chicken stock aromatics: onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and ???.
Answer: parsley
```

### Image Occlusion Cards
Portions of an image are hidden, requiring the learner to identify what's obscured. Particularly powerful for anatomy, diagrams, maps, and spatial relationships.

**Best for:**
- Anatomical structures
- Diagrams and charts
- Maps and spatial layouts
- Process flows and schematics

### Concept/Mind Map Occlusion
Similar to image occlusion but applied to concept maps or mind maps, testing understanding of relationships and structure.

### Multi-Line/List Cards
Specialized format for testing ordered or unordered lists, sets, and enumerations. Creates cards that ask for missing elements in consistent positions.

### Reverse and Bidirectional Cards
Cards that can be reviewed in reverse direction (answer as question, question as answer) or both directions. Useful for vocabulary, definitions, and relationships where bidirectional understanding is valuable.

## Examples

### Good vs Bad Cards

**Bad Example - Too Broad:**
```
Front: What do you need to make chicken stock?
Back: 2lbs chicken bones, 2qt water, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, parsley, simmer for 90 minutes
```
**Problems**: Not precise, mixes ingredients and procedure, too much detail for one card

**Good Example - Atomic:**
```
Front: What type of chicken parts are used in stock?
Back: Bones

Front: What is the ratio of chicken bones to water in chicken stock?
Back: A quart of water per pound of bones
```

**Bad Example - Vague:**
```
Front: How does transcription work?
Back: A process where RNA is made from DNA
```
**Problems**: Could be answered multiple ways, doesn't specify which aspect of transcription

**Good Example - Precise:**
```
Front: Where does transcription occur in eukaryotic cells?
Back: In the nucleus
```

**Bad Example - Yes/No:**
```
Front: Is transcription the process of making proteins?
Back: No
```
**Problems**: Promotes pattern matching, doesn't require meaningful retrieval

**Good Example - Active Recall:**
```
Front: What is the first product of the transcription process?
Back: mRNA (messenger RNA)
```

**Bad Example - Multiple Concepts:**
```
Front: What is the difference between meiosis and mitosis?
Back: [Long paragraph describing multiple differences]
```
**Problems**: Mixes location, process, timing, and outcome—too many "bulbs" to light

**Good Example - Atomic Cards:**
```
Front: What type of cell division produces haploid cells?
Back: Meiosis

Front: What type of cell division produces diploid cells?
Back: Mitosis

Front: How many daughter cells are produced in mitosis?
Back: Two

Front: How many daughter cells are produced in meiosis?
Back: Four
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Vague questions** that could be answered multiple ways
2. **Statements masquerading as questions** (e.g., just putting a term like "Mitochondria" on the front)
3. **Including the answer in the question** or making it trivial to infer
4. **Mixing multiple ideas** on one card
5. **Creating cards before understanding** the material
6. **Using yes/no format** that promotes shallow pattern matching
7. **Including too much context** that turns cards into summaries rather than tests
8. **Inconsistent phrasing** across similar cards that causes confusion
9. **Failing to consider the future self** who may not understand cryptic references
10. **Neglecting to integrate cards** with broader knowledge structures
